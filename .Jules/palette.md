## 2024-01-15 - Shadcn/UI Select in Data Tables
**Learning:** Native `<select>` elements inside Shadcn/UI based applications feel disconnected and lack the visual polish and accessibility features (like proper keyboard navigation styles) of the design system.
**Action:** When working with data tables or forms, always replace native `<select>` with Shadcn/UI `<Select>` component. Ensure to use `side="top"` for pagination controls at the bottom of the page to prevent clipping.
